# Public-DrossRemoval-Unity-Project
The Unity project for the Dross Removal experiment for my thesis titled: "Visual Feedback for Haptic Assisted Teleoperation of an Industrial Robot".

It should be noted that the dross particles have been removed from the project. The reason for this is that the dross particles are simulated using a paid third party asset called Obi Fluid. To be able to fully use the scene, the asset should be purchased, and imported separately from the Unity asset store.\\

The project was created using Unity 2020.1.9f1.
